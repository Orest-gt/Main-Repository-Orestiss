X = np.random.rand(10, 5)
y = np.array([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],

Clarification:

You can import your own dataset, but you make sure to change the needed parameter
And change the loss functions (i will do it to make it automatic in the future)

This is just a small and quick dataset to test my MLP model!
